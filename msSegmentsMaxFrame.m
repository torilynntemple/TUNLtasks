%%Splits activity in the specified # of segments and creates maximal projects for each.
%This function will normalize the calcium trace (from 0 to 1) and scale the
%brightness of the total maximal projection to the local segment maxima.
%Creating a series of spatial footprints representative of the maximal
%projects for each segment. 
%   INPUT:
%           -ms: miniscope structure, need these subparameters
%               *SFPs: Spatial Footprints of each cell. n by m by p, where
%               p is the cell# and n and m the spatial FOV.
%           -segments: User defined number of segments to separate activity
%   OUTPUT:
%           -Scalledfoot: n-by-m-by-p-by-s 4 dimensional matrix. Where n
%           and m are the spatial representation of cell p in segment s.
